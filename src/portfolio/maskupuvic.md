## Introduction

The #MaskUpUVic campaign is a collaborative, student-led public health campaign to help keep the [University of Victoria (UVic)](https://www.uvic.ca/) community safe with free N95-equivalent masks and COVID-19 rapid tests.

It is organized in collaboration with [The Canadian Red Cross](https://www.redcross.ca/), which supplies us with free respirators and tests, and several UVic student organizations:
- [University of Victoria Students' Society (UVSS)](https://uvss.ca/)
- [Society for Students with Disabilities (SSD)](https://uvicssd.ca/)
- [Students of Colour Collective (SOCC)](https://soccollective.com/)
- [Engineering Students' Society (ESS)](https://onlineacademiccommunity.uvic.ca/ess/)
- [Public Health and Social Policy Student Association (PHSPSA)](https://www.phspsa.com/)

After the province and university lifted their mask mandates with little warning in spring 2022, masking rates on campus dropped from nearly 100% to under 20%. Many students recognized a need to continue promoting masks and other infectious disease prevention practices on campus. We had hoped that distributing free, high-quality masks along with information on their importance would improve masking rates in classes.

In summer 2022, I learned about [The Canadian Red Cross's community mask and test program](https://www.redcross.ca/how-we-help/current-emergency-responses/covid-19-%E2%80%93-novel-coronavirus/covid-19-rapid-tests-and-masks-for-community-organizations), which supplies free N95-equivalent masks and COVID-19 rapid tests to registered non-profits and charities. I reached out to UVSS to see if they could apply for the program if I figured out how to store and distribute them. All of the student organizations and several individual volunteers helped with distribution at events and from a central pick-up point on campus. This campaign came together very quickly: it was just 2 weeks from our first meeting to our first distribution event.

As of January 2023, about 5 months since the campaign started, we have reached:
- 276 Instagram followers
- 54 Discord members
- 6120 KN95 masks distributed
- 756 COVID-19 rapid tests distributed

Some of my specific contributions to the campaign are described below.

## Project management

I coordinated many aspects of the campaign using tools like Trello and Discord.

## Logo design

I created the #MaskUpUVic logo (a smiley face wearing a face mask surrounded by the text '#MaskUpUVic') in several colour, size, and format variations, as well as some basic brand guidelines.

I designed and coordinated the production and payment for #MaskUpUVic logo stickers in a variety of colour variations to reflect the diversity of our community. These stickers were distributed along with our masks and tests.

I also prepared button pin templates so people could colour them in and make their own #MaskUpUVic pins!

## Print design

In addition to the stickers and badge templates, I designed and coordinated the printing of flyers, signs, and posters.
