## Summary
[Energy Efficiency Alberta](https://efficiencyalberta.ca/) is the [the province of Alberta's](https://www.alberta.ca/) agency responsible for promoting and supporting energy efficiency and community energy systems for homes, businesses, and communities.

They worked with [DDB Canada](https://www.ddb.ca/) to create a new website.

I was the lead front-end developer on this project. In addition to doing the majority of the front-end development work on this site, I also did some traditionally back-end work such as CMS configuration with [Craft CMS](https://craftcms.com/).

## Highlights

### Fully responsive
I ensured the site displays well at all screen sizes.

### Accessible
I carefully coded the site to be functional for keyboard users and screen reader users.

### CMS architecture
I configured the CMS to produce both an intuitive authoring experience for content authors, and data that supports the site's layout and design.

### Complex forms
I built out multi-step forms with validation, third-party API integrations, and bespoke form UI elements.

### Flexible components
I built out flexible components that could have multiple variations depending on its content and position in the page.
