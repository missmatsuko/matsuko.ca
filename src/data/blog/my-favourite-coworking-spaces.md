## Montreal

### Code & Café
[Code & Café](https://www.codecafe.cafe/) is a pay-as-you-go coworking space with unlimited coffee and pastries! Even posh oat milk lattés!

The decor is adorably geeky. Even [the pricelist](https://www.codecafe.cafe/tarifs/) is presented as an if-else statement!

They have an area where kids can learn to code, so there's lots of cool toys to see, although it can get a bit noisy.

### Temps Libre / Free Time
[Temps Libre](https://tempslibre.coop/) (or "Free Time" in English) is part paid coworking space, part free public space. I worked out of the free public space for a few days. The wi-fi is great, and there's a small shop to buy coffee and snacks. There's limited outlets, and the noise level can vary. There's also a kid's play area.

## Toronto

### DevHub
[DevHub](https://www.devhub.ca/) is a coworking space partnered with [Lighthouse Labs](https://www.lighthouselabs.ca/), a coding bootcamp.

I love that they have computer monitors to borrow on a first-come, first-serve basis. I worked out of the Toronto location for a week and they never ran out of monitors. I wish more coworking spaces did this - it's so handy!
