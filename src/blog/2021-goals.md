I didn't quite achieve most of [my 2020 goals](/blog/2020-goals), but I still made progress based on my intentions behind these goals.

For example, I wanted to read 50 books to challenge myself and to learn more. I didn't end up making it to 50 books, but I still read more books than I had in a while, and learned a lot. At the same time, this goal didn't always align with its intention. I often ended up pushing myself to finish a book I was no longer interested in just to increase my book count.

This year, I've decided to set [intentions rather than resolutions](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-empowerment-diary/201501/ditch-resolutions-make-intentions-instead). I think that setting more general intentions instead of specific resolutions will guide my activities to more honestly support my goals, and provide some much-needed flexibility in such uncertain times.

## Live more healthfully

2020 was a tough year for me in many ways, and I wasn't always on top of my mental and physical health.

For one thing, I ate way too many [Twix chocolate bars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twix) and had to get 4 cavities filled! I'm definitely staying away from those sticky treats in 2021.

I've never been very physically active, which is something I've been wanting to change for a while. I'm not sure what that's going to look like yet, especially since adult fitness classes in my province are largely on hold due to the COVID-19 pandemic. I have been curious about trying aerialism, so I'm going to start working towards that by improving my flexibiltiy with [the 30 day splits challenge](https://www.blogilates.com/30-days-30-stretches-to-splits-journeytosplits/).

I'm also thinking this might be a good time to start regular therapy sessions. Although I'm feeling much better these days, I think that regular check-ins with a therapist might prevent future dips in my mood before they get too serious.

**Progress**
- Still not eating Twix!
- Found the split challenge too intense, so started using [movr](https://movewithmovr.com/) and am aiming to get 1 5-minute movr mini done most days. Haven't been very consistent with it so far.
- Started online therapy sessions every 2 weeks with a registered counsellor.
- Got a more comfortable bike and started cruising around the neighbourhood on sunny days.
- Took an intro to aerials course and hope to continue aerial hammock next year.
- Tried to get into a regular gym habit over winter break, but provincial COVID restrictions put an end to that pretty quick.

## Foster creativity

I want to continue exploring creative activities and maybe find something I want to continue long-term.

I've already started online singing lessons, and have signed up for ceramics classes at a local recreation centre.

I'm also curious about [the maker culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maker_culture), and hope to get some more insight into that this year.

**Progress**
- Starting weekly online singing lessons with Felicia at [Sing IT Studio](https://www.singitstudio.com/).
- Rec centre ceramics classes were cancelled (twice!), so waiting for another creative opportunity.
- Started monthly [Maker Crates from KiwiCo](https://www.kiwico.com/maker) to try out different crafts. [Use my referral link for $10 off](https://www.kiwico.com/refer?i=MatsukoF)!

## Continue learning

Other than that, I'd like to continue learning in general.

I'm still working towards a [Bachelor of Arts (BA) in Health and Community Services at the University of Victoria (UVic)](https://www.uvic.ca/hsd/publichealthsocialpolicy/future-students/undergraduate/program/index.php) on a part-time basis.

I'm now working at [Craft CMS](https://craftcms.com/) as their lead accessibility engineer, and will continue learning a lot in this role.

I'm planning to keep reading, but I won't be aiming for a certain number of books like last year. Instead, I want to focus on interesting books, along with other formats like articles, podcasts, and videos.

I'd like to improve my American Sign Language (ASL) and French as well. Since I much prefer learning languages in-person, I'll wait and see if any such opportunities open up this year.

**Progress**
- Taking part-time courses at UVic, and am aiming to complete 2 courses each semester.
- Reading interesting books, which can be tracked on [my GoodReads 2021 challenge page](https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/25662614).
