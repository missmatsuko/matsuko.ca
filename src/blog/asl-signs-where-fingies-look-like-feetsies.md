I'm learning American Sign Language (ASL), and I'm making a list of signs where the index and middle fingers represent legs. I find these signs are especially intuitive, and pretty cute, too. Let me know if you have any additions (or corrections) for this list.

## Anxious / restless / squirmy

> The sign "SIT" can be modified to show someone squirming in their chair. This can be used to mean "anxiety" and similar concepts. This sign doesn't exactly mean nervous, it means "restless" or perhaps "ants in the pants."

## Dance

## Seizure (medical)
https://www.youtube.com/embed/D3DZClWcxt4

> The sign "seizure" when referring to a person having a seizure, would generally be done using the lexicalized classifier: "SEIZURE." The handshape starts with the bent-V and rolls on the palm twice.

## Toss and turn

## Pole dance
This was shown to me at an ASL meetup, and may not be a standard sign. It's similar to the sign for [mechanic](https://www.lifeprint.com/asl101/pages-signs/m/mechanic.htm), except the non-dominant hand points up to act as the pole.

## Climb (pole)
This was shown to me at an ASL meetup, and may not be a standard sign. It's similar to pole dance, except the V-hand climbs up the pole rather than swinging around it.

## Laid out / laid up / wasted physically / bedridden
Source: ["laid out" at LifePrint](https://www.lifeprint.com/asl101/pages-signs/l/laid-out.htm)

## Quit
> The sign for "quit" is based on the idea of "getting out" of something. The sign starts with the dominant "H" hand (think of legs) inside the non-dominant "C"-hand. Then you pull the "H"-hand out of the "C"-hand.

## Ride (horse / motorcycle / vehicle / rollercoaster)

## Ariel the little mermaid
This was taught to me by a Deaf ASL teacher in Vancouver, and may be a local sign. The index and middle fingers are put together and "swim" under the other hand which is flattened, then turns into "legs" and climbs up on the flat hand.

## Travel

## Join

> Memory aid:  Think of the "H" hand as representing your legs and you are "jumping" into something with both feet.
