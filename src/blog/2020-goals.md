## 1. Read 50 books
[Inspired by Bill Gates](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTFy8RnUkoU), I'm aiming to read 50 books this year to expand my mind and knowledge. [Check out my progress on Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/21371257).

**2020/12/30: Didn't quite make it to 50 books. I made a lot of progress but then the pandemic distracted me for a while. I got to 31 which is still plenty more books than I'd read in previous years!**

## 2. Exercise 50 times
This might sound really easy, but I'm notoriously terrible at exercising. Growing up, I hated gym and I never participated in sports. I still haven't found anything physically active that I really enjoy doing. Hopefully I'll find something tolerable by the end of 2020, but at the very least I'll try to exercise 50 times this year.

**2020/12/30: Sort of made this goal... I didn't want to count my on-off morning bike rides since I felt like they were too effortless to count as exercise, but I definitely would make it to 50 if I did.**

## 3. Visit a country I haven't been to before
So far I've only been to Canada, the US, and Japan. I'd like to add another country to this list by the end of 2020!

**2020/04/21: Unfortunately, this goal will be postponed to a later date due to the COVID-19 pandemic.**

## 4. Make a new friend (or maybe a few)
I feel like I've been spending too much time socializing online and not enough time with in real life (IRL) friends. I'm hoping to find a good IRL friend (or maybe more than one) who is not a [cishet](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cishet) man.

**2020/12/30: It's kind of hard to make new friends when you're stuck at home, but I did end up strengthening and resuscitating some existing friendships, and I'm thankful for that!**

## 5. Sing more and sing better
I enjoy singing, but mostly I sing by myself or at karaoke. I'd like to sing more often, and I'd like to improve my singing as well. I'm thinking about joining the [Sing City rock choir in Vancouver](http://singcity.ca/), but first I need to figure out if I'm sticking around Vancouver.

**2020/12/30: Once again, the pandemic foiled my plans. [Turns out choirs are not very COVID-friendly](https://www.livescience.com/covid-19-superspreader-singing.html). I didn't make much progress on this goal in 2020, but I did book my first singing lesson (online) for January 1, 2021!**

## 6. Learn more American Sign Language (ASL)
I'd like to continue learning ASL through courses and practice. I'm not sure if I'll get a chance to take a formal course this year, but I'd like to at least work through [ASLU's lessons](https://www.lifeprint.com/asl101/lessons/lessons.htm). I've finished up ASL 1 already, so I'll continue from ASL 2.

**2020/02/21: Finished vocabulary from ASL 2!**

**2020/08/17: Finished vocabulary from ASL 3!**
